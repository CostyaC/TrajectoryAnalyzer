# Trajectory Analyser

This is an old project I started many years ago in Pascal Programming Language, but now I've adapted it using Java and Python.
   Trajectory Analyser is a Pascal-based project that simulates the motion of a projectile and plots its trajectory. The program calculates the height and distance of a projectile at various time intervals and visualizes the trajectory using a Python script with Matplotlib. As mentioned it's based on Pascal, but using the prototype from Pascal I changed into Java. You can check all the files, so you will understand that the idea of implementation is the same, it just differs the programming language. Taking into Consideration Java is an advanced programming level language I decided to make an update for my old project, which I started it many years ago.

## Features

- Calculates the projectile's trajectory based on initial velocity and launch angle.
- Outputs the distance and height of the projectile at specified intervals.
- Plots the trajectory graph using Matplotlib.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK
- Python 3.x using library called Matplotlib
- Pascal

### Running the Java Program

1. **Compile the Java program:**
   ```bash
   javac src/PascalProject/ProjectileMotion.java

2. waiting for the user input for the following Values :
Vinit - initial Velocity
Angle - the angle to which the object is going to be thrown
and the dx parameter represents the increment in the distance x for each iteration of the loop.

3. After the values are read from the keyboard, an output is going to be shown into the console and also saved as output data to a file called "OUT.txt"

4. Linking Visual Code & Python
