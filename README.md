# TrajectoryAnalyzer
This is an old project I started many years ago in Pascal Programming Language, but now I've adapted it using Java and Python.

# Trajectory Analyser

Trajectory Analyser is a Java-based project that simulates the motion of a projectile and plots its trajectory. The program calculates the height and distance of a projectile at various time intervals and visualizes the trajectory using a Python script with Matplotlib.

## Features

- Calculates the projectile's trajectory based on initial velocity and launch angle.
- Outputs the distance and height of the projectile at specified intervals.
- Plots the trajectory graph using Matplotlib.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib (Python library)

### Running the Java Program

1. **Compile the Java program:**
   ```bash
   javac src/PascalProject/ProjectileMotion.java
